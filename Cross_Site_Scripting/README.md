## Overview üìñ
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts can execute in the browser context, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information, hijack sessions, or redirect users to malicious sites.

XSS vulnerabilities often arise due to insufficient input validation or improper output encoding. While these issues are common, their impact can range from low to critical depending on the nature of the vulnerable application and the data it handles.
