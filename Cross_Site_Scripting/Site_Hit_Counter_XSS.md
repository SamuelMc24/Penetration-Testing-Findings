![Tools Used](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Burp%20Suite%2C%20Dalfox%2C%20XSStrike%2C%20Wayback%20Machine-blue)

## Overview 📖
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when malicious input is reflected back to the browser without proper sanitization or encoding. This vulnerability was identified in a **Site Hit Counter** application, where the input parameter used to track site statistics was not validated securely.

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the affected website, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, and unauthorized actions.

## Remediation Recommendations 🛡️
1. **Input Validation:**  
   Ensure all user inputs are validated against a whitelist of allowed characters. Reject unexpected or malformed inputs.
   
2. **Output Encoding:**  
   Properly encode all output data before rendering it in the browser to prevent script execution.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  
   Implement a strict CSP to block unauthorized scripts from executing.

4. **Regular Testing:**  
   Conduct routine security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities promptly.
