# Information Disclosure Findings

## Overview üìñ
Information disclosure vulnerabilities occur when sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized users. Over the past two years, I identified numerous such vulnerabilities across government systems, including exposed configuration files, publicly accessible log files containing sensitive information, and other data leakage issues. These findings often revealed sensitive details, including server configurations, personally identifiable information (PII), and backend application settings.

## Notable Examples üö®

### Exposed `.htaccess` Files
- **Description:** Publicly accessible `.htaccess` files revealed server security mechanisms such as input sanitization rules, directory restrictions, and custom redirects.
- **Impact:** Provided attackers with insights into the server's defensive structure, increasing the risk of bypassing protections.
- **Recommendation:** Remove or restrict access to `.htaccess` files.

### Publicly Accessible Data Record Files
- **Description:** Exposed log files contained PII, such as names, phone numbers, and locations.
- **Impact:** Enabled social engineering attacks like phishing and vishing.
- **Recommendation:** Secure endpoints containing sensitive files and implement access controls.

### Configuration File Disclosures
- **Description:** Publicly downloadable `web.config` and `.editorconfig` files exposed backend server configurations.
- **Impact:** Potential exposure of database connection strings, application settings, and other sensitive information.
- **Recommendation:** Remove unnecessary files or restrict access to authenticated users only.

### PHP Information Disclosure
- **Description:** A publicly accessible PHP page (`/test2.php`) exposed detailed server configuration data, including PHP version, server API type, and registered transports.
- **Impact:** Provided attackers with reconnaissance details to craft targeted attacks against the host.
- **Recommendation:** Restrict access to sensitive pages, remove public PHP information pages, and apply firewall rules to block access to sensitive URLs.

## Exploitation Risks üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Targeted Attacks:** Leveraging exposed data to craft phishing or social engineering campaigns.
2. **System Compromise:** Using exposed configuration details to exploit server vulnerabilities.
3. **Privacy Violations:** Exposing PII increases risks of fraud and harassment.
4. **Credential Theft:** Accessing sensitive authentication details for unauthorized access.

## Recommendations üõ°Ô∏è
1. **Restrict Public Access:** Apply proper access controls to sensitive files and endpoints.
2. **Remove Unnecessary Files:** Delete configuration and log files that are not required.
3. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic reviews to identify and mitigate information disclosure vulnerabilities.
4. **Monitor for Data Leaks:** Implement monitoring solutions to detect exposed sensitive information promptly.
