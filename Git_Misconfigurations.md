# Git Misconfigurations

## Overview üìñ
Git misconfigurations can expose sensitive application configuration files or even the entire source code repository, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security risks. Common misconfigurations include leaving `.git` directories publicly accessible or exposing the `.git/config` file, which may reveal sensitive information about the application, its dependencies, or credentials.

As a Penetration Tester, I have identified multiple instances of Git misconfigurations, resulting in high-severity findings reported to government agencies. Below are sanitized examples demonstrating my methodologies, tools used, and recommendations provided.

## Findings üìÇ

### Finding 1: Exposed `.git/config` File
- **Description:** The application exposed the `.git/config` file, which contained sensitive metadata about the repository. This could potentially allow an attacker to clone the repository or gather information to exploit other vulnerabilities.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to source code, leading to the discovery of other vulnerabilities or sensitive information.
- **Recommendation:**
  1. Restrict access to the `.git` directory using web server configurations.
  2. Relocate `.git` directories outside the web root.
  3. Implement firewall rules to block access to sensitive paths.
  4. Regularly scan and validate exposed directories for misconfigurations.

### Finding 2: Directory Browsing Enabled for `.git`
- **Description:** Directory browsing was enabled for the `.git` directory, allowing unauthorized users to view its contents and download the repository.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to source code, configuration files, and sensitive data.
- **Recommendation:**
  1. Disable directory browsing in the web server configuration.
  2. Set proper permissions to restrict access to sensitive directories.
  3. Regularly review and harden web server configurations.
- **References:** CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing

## Key Recommendations üåü
1. **Secure Web Server Configurations:**
   - Disable directory browsing.
   - Restrict access to sensitive paths using `.htaccess` or equivalent configurations.
2. **Relocate Sensitive Directories:**
   - Move `.git` directories outside of the web root to prevent accidental exposure.
3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Automate scans to identify exposed directories and configuration files.
4. **Employee Training:**
   - Educate developers and administrators on secure development and deployment practices.
