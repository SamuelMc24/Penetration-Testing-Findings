# Penetration Testing Findings

## Overview
This repository highlights real-world vulnerabilities exploited during my time as a Penetration Tester at ECS Federal, where I contributed to securing government systems through both continuous monitoring and scheduled penetration testing. Working under a contract covering over 25,000 hosts across various government bureaus, I identified and exploited vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and web applications.

The repository includes examples of findings such as:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Exploiting input validation flaws to execute malicious scripts.
End-of-Life (EOL) Software: Scanning and identifying outdated software versions, leading to critical severity reports.
Information Disclosures: Discovering sensitive files and data exposed to the public, impacting confidentiality and compliance.
Each section showcases sanitized findings, the tools and methodologies used, and the results delivered to clients. In addition to penetration testing, I served as the SME for my team on Recorded Future, utilizing the tool to identify vulnerabilities, write documentation, and train team members.

Tools featured in this work include Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Nessus, OWASP ZAP, Splunk, Nuclei, Appscan, and Recorded Future, among others.
