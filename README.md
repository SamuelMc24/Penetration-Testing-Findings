## Summary üöÄ
This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of vulnerabilities identified and exploited during real-world penetration tests conducted at ECS Federal. It highlights key findings across various categories, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), End-of-Life (EOL) Software, and Information Disclosures, among others.

Key Features:
- üåê Real-world examples of exploited vulnerabilities.
- üõ†Ô∏è Insights into tools and methodologies used for penetration testing.
- üìä Organized findings categorized for clarity and relevance.

By exploring this repository, you will gain an understanding of how vulnerabilities are identified, validated, and addressed, demonstrating practical expertise in cybersecurity.

## Overview üìñ
This repository highlights real-world vulnerabilities exploited during my time as a Penetration Tester at ECS Federal, where I contributed to securing government systems through both continuous monitoring and scheduled penetration testing. Working under a contract covering over 25,000 hosts across various government bureaus, I identified and exploited vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and web applications.

The repository includes examples of findings such as:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Exploiting input validation flaws to execute malicious scripts.
- **End-of-Life (EOL) Software:** Scanning and identifying outdated software versions, leading to critical severity reports.
- **Information Disclosures:** Discovering sensitive files and data exposed to the public, impacting confidentiality and compliance.

Each section showcases sanitized findings, the tools and methodologies used, and the results delivered to clients. In addition to penetration testing, I served as the SME for my team on Recorded Future, utilizing the tool to identify vulnerabilities, write documentation, and train team members.

## Methodologies üõ†Ô∏è

Dive into my **[Penetration Testing Methodologies](./Methodologies.md)** to explore the systematic approaches I use to uncover vulnerabilities, assess security risks, and recommend remediations. This section covers:

- **Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:** Techniques for collecting actionable intelligence about target systems.
- **Exploitation Tactics:** Real-world methods to demonstrate the impact of identified vulnerabilities.
- **Validation and Retesting:** Ensuring mitigations are effective and vulnerabilities no longer pose a risk.
- **Reporting Best Practices:** Delivering clear, actionable, and impactful reports to stakeholders.

By adhering to structured methodologies, I ensure a thorough, repeatable, and efficient penetration testing process that meets industry standards and adapts to evolving security challenges.
