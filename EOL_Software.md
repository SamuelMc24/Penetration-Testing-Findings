# End-of-Life (EOL) Software Findings

![Tools Used](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tools-Burp%20Suite%2C%20Nuclei%2C%20Wappalyzer-blue)

## Overview 📖
Over the past two years, I identified **50+ hosts** running End-of-Life (EOL) software, resulting in **15+ critical-severity reports**. EOL software, including outdated versions of Drupal, PHP, WordPress, Nginx, Python, Bootstrap, and more, significantly increases security risks due to the lack of security patches and vendor support.

These findings highlight the critical impact of unsupported software in sensitive environments and the need for proactive upgrade strategies.

## Notable Examples 🚨
### Drupal EOL
- **Version:** Drupal 8 (EOL: November 2, 2021)
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Privilege Escalation.
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to Drupal 9 or 10.

### PHP EOL
- **Versions Identified:** PHP 5.4.16, PHP 7.0.33 (EOL as of December 3, 2018).
- **Impact:** RCE, SQL Injection, XSS, Privilege Escalation.
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to PHP 8.2 or higher.

### Nginx and Bootstrap EOL
- **Versions:**
  - Nginx 1.21.3 (EOL: June 21, 2022)
  - Bootstrap 4.5.2 (EOL: January 1, 2023)
- **Impact:** RCE, XSS, Denial of Service (DoS), Security Misconfigurations.
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to supported versions of Nginx and Bootstrap.

## Exploitation Risks 🛠️
1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities to gain full system control.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts to compromise user data.
3. **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining unauthorized administrative access.
4. **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting critical services.
5. **SQL Injection:** Accessing and manipulating sensitive database information.

## Recommendations 🛡️
1. **Upgrade EOL Software:** Migrate to supported versions to receive regular security updates.
2. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic assessments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
3. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up monitoring for software lifecycle updates and vulnerabilities.
4. **Employee Training:** Ensure staff are aware of the risks associated with EOL software.
