![Risk Rating](https://img.shields.io/badge/Risk-High-red) ![Type](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Misconfiguration-blue)

## Overview üìñ
SharePoint is a widely used collaboration platform for managing content and documents. Misconfigurations, such as exposing sensitive files or granting excessive permissions, can lead to unauthorized access to confidential information. During testing, several SharePoint environments were identified with misconfigurations that exposed sensitive data and internal documentation.

## Technical Details üîç

### Description
The following SharePoint misconfigurations were identified:
- **Publicly Accessible Files:** Documents and folders containing sensitive information were accessible without authentication.
- **Improper Permissions:** Excessive permissions were granted to anonymous or guest users.
- **Exposed Administrative Pages:** Configuration and administrative interfaces were accessible, increasing the risk of unauthorized changes.

### Impact
These misconfigurations increase the risk of:
1. Unauthorized access to sensitive corporate or government data.
2. Information disclosure that could aid attackers in crafting targeted attacks.
3. Potential compromise of internal systems due to exposed administrative access.

The following file was discovered during enumeration:
```
/sharepoint/documents/internal_policy.docx
```

## Recommendations üõ°Ô∏è

1. **Restrict Public Access:**
   - Configure SharePoint permissions to limit access to authenticated users only.

2. **Audit Permissions:**
   - Regularly review and adjust permissions to follow the principle of least privilege.

3. **Secure Administrative Pages:**
   - Restrict access to configuration and administrative interfaces using IP whitelisting or VPN access.

4. **Enable Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Track access attempts and review logs for unauthorized activities.

5. **Conduct Security Assessments:**
   - Periodically test SharePoint environments for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
