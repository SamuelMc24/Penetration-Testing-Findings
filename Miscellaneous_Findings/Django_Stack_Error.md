# Django Stack Error

![Risk Rating](https://img.shields.io/badge/Risk-Medium-yellow) ![Type](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Information_Disclosure-blue)

## Overview üìñ
A Django stack error occurs when an application is configured to display detailed error messages or stack traces during runtime. These errors often include sensitive information such as framework versions, file paths, and internal configuration details. If exposed to unauthorized users, this information can be used to craft targeted attacks.

## Technical Details üîç

### Description
During testing, a Django application was found to expose stack traces publicly when encountering runtime errors. These traces included:
- Detailed file paths and line numbers.
- Environment variables and debug information.
- Application settings and installed libraries.

### Impact
The disclosed information increases the attack surface by:
1. Providing attackers with insights into the application‚Äôs internal structure.
2. Revealing framework and library versions that may have known vulnerabilities.
3. Disclosing sensitive configuration data, such as API keys or environment variables (if improperly sanitized).

## Evidence üìÇ

### Example Stack Trace (Sanitized)
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/views.py", line 42, in example_function
    result = some_undefined_function()
NameError: name 'some_undefined_function' is not defined

Django Version: 3.2.5
Python Version: 3.8.10
```

### Tools Used
- **Burp Suite:** Intercepted error-generating requests.
- **Browser Inspection:** Verified stack trace visibility.
- **Custom Payloads:** Triggered unexpected application behavior.

## Recommendations üõ°Ô∏è

1. **Disable Debug Mode:**
   - Ensure that `DEBUG = False` in the Django settings for production environments.

2. **Implement Custom Error Pages:**
   - Configure the application to display generic error messages without revealing stack traces.

3. **Sanitize Sensitive Data:**
   - Ensure that error handling mechanisms do not expose sensitive information such as environment variables or configuration details.

4. **Regularly Update Dependencies:**
   - Keep Django and associated libraries updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

5. **Conduct Security Reviews:**
   - Periodically review application configurations and error handling mechanisms.
