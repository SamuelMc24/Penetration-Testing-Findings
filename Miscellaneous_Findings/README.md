## Overview üìñ
This section showcases a diverse range of unique findings identified during penetration testing engagements. These findings highlight vulnerabilities that do not fit into standard categories yet demonstrate critical risks to systems, including exposed administrative interfaces, configuration leaks, and misconfigurations in web services and protocols. By addressing these vulnerabilities, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface.
